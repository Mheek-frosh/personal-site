# My Portfolio Site

This is actually the third version of my portfolio and this time I'm using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and TailwindCss on the frontend and sanity.io for as my backend headless CMS.


## How to setup locally
If you want to use this as a template for building up your portfolio, feel free to clone the project, but I'll recommend customizing the site to fit you and not just make a direct clone.

Look through the env.example to see what you need to run the project locally on your system.

Visit [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/) docs to learn more about using sanity and get your sanity project id.
